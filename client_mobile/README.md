## üîç About

[Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is a 3rd year Epitech project about creating an IFTTT-like web client and mobile app.

## üíª Requirements

Supported operating systems:
- Android

## üîß Building

- Get the apk from http://localhost:8081/client.apk (refer to the client-web and server ReadMEs to set them up)
- Run the apk by taping it

## üéÆ Usage

You can register with an email and password or through your Google account

Once registered you'll be on the dashboard page

There's a disconnect button at the top right to disconnect your account and you can reconnect (different than register, click the link in the little message below)

There's also a Dashboard button to go to the dashboard page (when in a brick which are talked about down below) and a Services button where you can connect to your Twitter and/or Twitch accounts to use them later

On the dashboard page you can create a new brick by clicking the "+" button

On the brick creation popup that just appeared you can give (or not) the brick's name and/or description

Once the brick is created you can click on its "Edit" button to edit its name/description or delete it (or cancel the Edit)

Bricks hold their own action/reactions connections, feel free to organize your services tasks through them

When you click on a brick (anywhere but on its "Edit" button) you'll access it

In a brick you can create either actions (which will trigger every x seconds/minutes depending on the service and type of action) or reactions (which will take the output from reactions and execute a task with it) by clicking on their appropriate "+" buttons.

The creation popup contains:
- The service (actions have no-authentification services like clock, weather, cypto or One Piece and also auth ones like Twitter and Twitch if you connected to them, reactions only have auth those 2 auth ones)
- The action/reaction type (like get all tweets from an user, get all streamers on Minecraft, activate when a time is reached etc...)
- The arguments to give to that action/reaction (tooltip appears when the mouse hovers the text area)
- The description (not mandatory)

You can then, just like for bricks, click on the "Edit" button of each action/reaction to modify any of its explained-above fields or delete them (or cancel the edit).
